                  <h3 class ="topichead">Assessment of suitability and evaluation of alcohol blends (1 Year) </h3>
                  <p class="para">This project was carried out in National interest to evaluate the performance of alcohol blends with diesel and petrol on Indian vehicles. Number of motor cycles, passenger cars, auto rickshaws and heavy duty engines are tested for effect of alcohol blend fuels on regulated emissions (CO, HC, NOx, PM) and unregulated emissions (Aldehydes, Ketones) . Also Effect of alcohol blends on vehicle durability is studied.</p>
                  <h3 class ="topichead">Up gradation of Beckman make CV sampling system and Controller (1 Year)</h3>
                  <p class ="para">The old microprocessor based Beckman make CVS controller is replaced with in-house built, more efficient and user friendly PC based controller. The old CVS sampling system and PM sampling system are redesigned using new components. New software is developed in LAB View.
                    </p>
                  <h3 class="topichead">Condition Monitoring of Control Valve (Post-graduation project )</h3>
                  <p class="para">System is developed to monitor the heath of control valve which is key component in process industry. Developed system takes noise and vibration signatures of control valve and compares them with stored signature of healthy control valve.   All digital signal processing and GUI is made in MATLAB.</p>
                  <h3 class="topichead">Micro Controller Based Syringe Infusion Pump (Graduation project)</h3>
                  <p class="para">The infusion pump helps medical practitioners with ability to inject small amount of drug over long period in cases like painless delivery, insulin injection to critical diabetic patient. In this system microcontroller controls the rotational speed of the stepper motor, proportional to the programmed infusion rate. A keypad and display are used to take input from user. Pump is also provided with alarm and emergency stop button.</p>
