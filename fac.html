            <p class="para1">In December 2020 my twins cleared their 11 plus exams with flying colours and I realised that my children are becoming independent allowing me to pursue what I am longing for ages. My dream to become coder started shooting up!
               <br> <br>At first, I was aimless not knowing where to start. Because of previous basic knowledge, C, C++ was looking comfortable. Python was tempting as being popular language nowadays. Oracle cloud was looking promising as it is growing technology in data management and handling.  Finally, my niece suggested that JavaScript and web development has brighter openings for trainee job seekers.  I started searching bootcamps affordable to my pocket. And I ended up with Founder and Coders â€“ the ideal place for me. <br>
                I joined FAC community in mid-April with blank slate and my world completely changed. I already started feeling that I am part of Tech. My imposter syndrome warded off. After seeing people with different backgrounds and culture, I felt I AM NOT ALONE and TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE IT!
               <br> <br>Well planned and designed prerequisite of course not only make base for coming extensive course but it also gives insight to applicant about web development. Java script demands logical and analytical thinking, while web page design needs eye of creativity and imagination. I started loving web development while doing my assignments. And I can see FAC Autumn cohort as first step towards my dream to become web developer. 
                <br><br>Here are some of my reasons for joining FAC and its cohort:

            <p style="float:left"class="para2">2-	Together we can grow: -   We all are social animals. We strive more if we work together.  This principle is reflected in FAC culture.  It encourage all to come together discuss their technical queries, ideas , new learnings. And this is  tying all in one family thread where growing in group is emphasised . Previous students are mentoring new comers. There experiences and skills reducing the hurdles in the journey of new joiners. I attended two Monday meetups (I love Monday Meetups)  where my both the mentors were encouraging and guided me to get correct information for my web application.</p>
